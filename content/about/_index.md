Welcome to my portfolio site. On these pages you will find various efforts at understanding, some more successful than others. The site is currently in development so I'd ask that you forgive the rough edges. 

Ultimately, the site should contain a series of deep-dives into machine learning methods and statistical algorithms. 
But I reserve the right to evolve the content in directions informed by whimsy.
